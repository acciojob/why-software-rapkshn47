	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1><br>
	<p>Coding is something that has amused me for a long time. Just the fact that 
	merely a bunch of lines written in a syntactic order creating something 
	functional is actually a pretty much magical. So, yeah. Learning to code is something
	that I really ador very much. Solving every questions by failing a number of times and
	 after all that finally being able to submit with full TC passed does really 
	put a smike on my face.</p>
